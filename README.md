# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze and predict stock market trends. By learning from historical stock price data, the model aims to forecast future stock prices and assist investors in making data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Stock markets are inherently volatile and complex. Traditional statistical models often fall short in capturing long-term dependencies and nonlinear patterns in time-series data. LSTM networks, a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN), are well-suited for sequence prediction problems due to their ability to retain information over long periods.

This project:
- Utilizes LSTM networks to predict future stock prices.
- Trains the model on historical stock data (e.g., Open, Close, High, Low, Volume).
- Provides visualizations of actual vs predicted prices.
- Can be extended for real-time forecasting and trading strategies.
